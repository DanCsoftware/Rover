# Rover - AI-Powered Discord Assistant

Making Discord servers navigable. Rover helps users find information, summarize conversations, and discover relevant channels without getting lost.

## The Problem
Discord servers with 100+ channels are overwhelming. New members can't find information. Power users waste time scrolling through chat history. Critical updates get buried.

## The Solution
Rover adds intelligent assistance:
- **Smart Navigation**: "Where do people discuss X?" → Rover finds the right channel
- **Conversation Summaries**: "What did I miss?" → Rover summarizes key points
- **Link Safety**: Automatic scanning for phishing/malware
- **Channel Discovery**: Suggests relevant channels based on your interests
